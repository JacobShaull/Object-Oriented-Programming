# Object-Oriented-Programming
demonstrating my competency in writing python modules, object-oriented-programming, code style and testing. 
My Acme.py file holds my product and boxing glove classes that have different functions.
My acme report has two funtions:
- Generates a list of 30 acme products with randomly generated values for class attributes
- Returns unique names, avg price, weight and flammability
Acme_test holds 4 tests ex. Test default product price being 10, or tests products stealability returnes  correct values
